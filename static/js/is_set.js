// This file contains the logic flow for determining whether a group of three cards is a set. 
// Each card will have four attributes = fill, shape, number, and color. 
// In order for the group to be a set, all attributes must either be the same or different
// across the three card. 

// See https://www.setgame.com/sites/default/files/instructions/SET%20INSTRUCTIONS%20-%20ENGLISH.pdf 
// for details about set.
